## Project Overview
The "Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis" project aims to classify hotel reviews into positive and negative sentiments. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project provides valuable insights into customer satisfaction and areas needing improvement.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    git clone 
    ```sh
    https://github.com/rohit-borole/Hotel-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Gradio-Interface.git
    ```
    ```sh
    cd Hotel-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Gradio-Interface
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare Data**: Ensure your dataset is in the appropriate format (CSV) and located in the `data` directory.
2. **Run Preprocessing**:
    ```sh
    python preprocess.py
    ```
3. **Train Model**:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```
4. **Evaluate Model**:
    ```sh
    python evaluate.py
    ```

## Data
The dataset should consist of hotel reviews labeled with their corresponding sentiment (positive or negative). Place your dataset in the `data` directory. The dataset should be in CSV format with the following columns:
- `review`: The text of the hotel review.
- `sentiment`: The sentiment label (positive/negative).

## Model Training
The model training script (`train.py`) uses a combination of NLP techniques for text preprocessing and a machine learning algorithm for classification. Key steps include:
1. Text preprocessing (tokenization, removing stop words, etc.)
2. Feature extraction (TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.)
3. Model training (logistic regression, SVM, etc.)

## Evaluation
The evaluation script (`evaluate.py`) assesses the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This script requires the test dataset to be in the `data` directory.

## Results
The results of the model evaluation will be saved in the `results` directory. This includes metrics and visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves.
